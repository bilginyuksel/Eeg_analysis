Welcome to robotic arm simulation GUI Application.
This application created by Kaan Yuksel Bilgin.
In this application you can simulate/test your robotic activities or any kind of functional activities.
First of all you have to configure the applications needs, like objects width,height and targets width,height also their positions on x,y axis.
After that configuration process over you have to prepare the simulation. After preparation now you can run the simulation and see
the process. Also you can export your test results to a .txt file. 
Enjoy with the application greetings!
