Follow these for expert generation process...

We see that real data has a continious loop. It starts 
at minimum it goes to maximum, and goes to minimum again.

We have to generate data according to this looping. We have to examine
real data's periods. 

First of all find the periods that the exact data has. Then
find where optimum data is placed. And generate data periods.
Always track periods and try to generate data on this line.

Collect the informations (Period time or data count to complete a period):
    - In a period know how many percent of data maximized ?
    - How many percent minimized on a period?
