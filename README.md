EEG Data Analysis and Robotic Arm Test Simulation 
<br>
Beginner step to developer BCI Systems. <br>
I took the open source EEG data from [url](www.google.com). Data belongs to 21 year old male healthy human with right handed.
In that open-source data there are several eeg recordings. Recordings are labeled per trial as(LeftBackward,LeftForward,RightBackward and so on.).
<br>
I analyzed data and i created a bunch of machine learning models and a CNN network. And i exported the models that i have trained for later use. 
<br>
After exporting models i created a 2d GUI simulation program with python. In that program i imported my pretrained models. On simulation 
i used persons imagination data, i thought it is similar to creating thoughts on real time. And according to simulation needs i took 
random rows from imagination data to predict.
